## When Conflict Occurs: 5-Step Process (冲突解决5步法)

### Step 1: Check Yourself

* Am I emotionally flooded? (heart racing, can't think, sweating)
* If YES: Take 20-minute break, return when calm
* Use deep breathing: 4 counts in, 6 counts out

### Step 2: Gentle Start-Up

**Use:** "I feel \[emotion] when \[specific situation]. I need \[specific request]."

**Avoid:** "You always/never..." or "You're so..."

**Examples:**

* Good: "I feel lonely when we don't talk at dinner. I need us to put phones away."
* Bad: "You never pay attention to me!"

### Step 3: Accept Influence

Find something valid in your partner's view.

**Say:**

* "You have a point..."
* "I understand why you feel..."
* "I hadn't thought of it that way"

### Step 4: Make Repair Attempts

When tension rises, use:

* "I need to calm down"
* "Sorry, I overreacted"
* "Let me try again"
* "Can we take a break?"
* Humor (if appropriate for your relationship)

### Step 5: Compromise

1. Identify non-negotiables (inner circle)
2. Identify flexible areas (outer circle)
3. Find the overlap
4. Try a 2-month experiment
