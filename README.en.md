## Usage Examples

> The following examples are from real-life scenarios

- My wife never puts trash in the bin and never returns things to their place after using them. I clean up after her every day without any appreciation. Instead, when I remind her, she wants to move out. What should I do?
- I've been with my girlfriend for almost a year. I prepare gifts for every holiday and cover all daily expenses, buying whatever she wants. But I've never received a single gift from her. When she's upset, she gives me the silent treatment. Today is Chinese Valentine's Day, I gave her a gift but couldn't get a restaurant reservation due to crowds, so we grabbed a quick bite at a cafe. Now she's angry. What should I do?
- Over a decade ago, I called my ex-husband crying, saying: "Your mom and sister are bullying me..." He replied: "That's my mom and my sister! That's just how they are!" Later, my mom gently taught him: "As a husband, you need to be a peacemaker between your mother and wife." He said: "You can change wives, but you can't change mothers!" So we divorced after a year and a half of marriage...
